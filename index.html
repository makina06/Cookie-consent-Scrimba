          Want a great job in tech? Want a six-figure salary? Then you have come
          to the right place. I am going to tell you all you need to know to get
          all of that and much more, without you lifting a finger. You can learn
          passively. Just sit back, close your eyes, and let the sound of my
          voice make the code sink deep into your brain.
